# 🟢🟡🔴 Room Guessing Guide

In **Bludle**, colors are used to give feedback on your guesses for each characteristic of the room. Here's how to interpret them:

---

## 🟢 Green — Correct ✅

- The characteristic is **exactly correct**.
- No ambiguity — your answer matches the hidden room’s trait perfectly.

---

## 🟡 Yellow — Partially Correct 🧐

Your answer is **close**, but not a perfect match. Here's what that means for different traits:

### 🧺 Items Received
- **Yellow** appears when your guess involves receiving an item (e.g. coins), but **not in the exact way** as the correct room.
- Examples:
  - You guessed a room that **sometimes gives** coins, but the correct room **always gives** coins.
  - The room gives coins **along with other items**, but your guess was only "coins".
- 🕳️ Holes to dig and other hidden mechanics **do not count** — only what is explicitly mentioned in the room selection text.

### 🚪 Doors
- **Only the doors you actually open** are counted.
- Example:
  - **Entrance Hall** is considered to have **3 doors**, even though you only open two — one is visible but inaccessible.
  - **Chamber** is considered to have **4 doors**, even if you don’t choose them.
- Yellow might appear if your door count is close, but not a perfect match.

### ⚖️ Logic (AND / OR Rules)
- Some rooms **always** give something, others **might** give depending on conditions.
- A yellow clue might indicate:
  - You guessed a room that gives either A **or** B, but the correct room gives A **and** B.
  - You got part of the logic right, but not the full structure.

## 🧾 What Counts as “Receives”

If a room gives you **any** of the following **in the room selection text**, it counts as “receives”:

- 💰 Coins
- 💎 Gems
- 🔑 Keys
- items
- puzzle

⚠️ Note: Only items clearly mentioned in the room’s selection screen are counted. Hidden mechanics or bonus events don’t qualify.

## 🔴 Red — Incorrect ❌

- Your guess is **completely wrong** for that characteristic.
- There's **no overlap** between your guess and the correct answer.
