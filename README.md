Welcome!  
This is a **fan-made, non-profit web game** inspired by [Gamedle's Guess the Game](https://www.gamedle.wtf/), but with a **Blue Prince** twist!

You'll explore rooms, solve puzzles, and try to guess **“The Room of the Day”** using logic and deduction — all wrapped in the mysterious and surreal universe of *Blue Prince*.

> ⚠️ This is a passion project made with love for the game and its community. All rights to **Blue Prince** belong to [Dogubomb Inc.](https://www.blueprincegame.com/). See the [Disclaimer](#-disclaimer) below for more info.

## 🎮 How It Works

- Every day, a new room is selected — your goal is to guess which one!
- Each room has **five hidden characteristics** (rarity, location, etc.).
- When you guess correctly, you can:
  - **Earn keys**, which unlock puzzles involving the famous **three boxes**: truth, lie, and ???.
  - Solve these to earn powerful **hints**.
- It's not just guessing — it's about solving the mystery through clues.

## 🧠 Brainstorm and Ideas

Some ideas I'm working on or planning to add:

- 👑 Crown animation when you guess the correct room.
- 🕳️ “You are not yet worthy of Mountain Valley…” message if you fail.
- 🎭 Alternate game modes:
  - **Censored Room Mode** – the room name is hidden by tiles you uncover.
  - **Quote Mode** – get in-game quotes and guess which room it refers to.
  - **Puzzle Mode** – more logic-based mechanics beyond daily guesses.
- 📜 Lore:
  - You are an employee trying to find where **Young Calitou** is each day.
- 🧩 Rewards:
  - **Coins** = ask Alzhar for help (e.g., “Is this a rare room?”).
  - **Keys** = solve the three-box puzzle.
  - **Gems** = (idea still in development).
- 🧙 Alzhar will appear to offer cryptic hints when summoned.
